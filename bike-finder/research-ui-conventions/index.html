                    Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts? Did I know what this element would do before I interacted with it? Why?
                    <ul class="notes">
                        <li>These are all very common UI elements, so I've seen them before. Furthermore, because they are so common and the fact the elements are used intuitively, the elements behaved exactly as I expected. </li>
                        <li>The only thing that surprised me was the lack of filtering on the search, since that's a convention. </li>

                    What general problem is this element designed to handle?
                    <ul>
                        <li class="notes">All these elements are designed to help the user find the slime they want and purchase it. I also guess it's used to encourage exploration, especially with the carousel, to entice users to buy more slimes then they might've intended on purchasing.</li>

                </li>

                    Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?
                    <ul>
                        <li class="notes">I would say it was successful. Every element is intuitive. However, I feel as the process could definitely improve, such as the expansion of the filtering section. </li>

                            <li>Summarize CTA/Get Quote: Pulls a popup that lets me request the car I want. I've never bought a car, so "get quote" was unknown terminology to me. I only clicked on it since it was center and bold.</li>

                    Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I've seen the more simple elements in other contexts, but I've rarely seen combined UI elements such as a dropdown carousel. I like this site because of its clean and innovative functionality.
                        </li>
                        
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Did I know what this element would do before I interacted with it? Why?
                    <ul><li>
                        Although I did encounter elements that I've rarely used before, I feel like I expected most of the behavior just becuase of the clean presentation and also because the elements were built off of familiar UI elements. 
                    </li></ul>

                </li>
                <li>
                    What general problem is this element designed to handle?
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The problem of this site is to help its users find a car they want to purchase. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            My guess is that most of the users on this site are here to purchase a car or learn more about a specific car. Basically, rather than exploring, users know what they want. As such, the front page mostly shows off the vehicles that users will want to buy or learn more about. I'd say it was successful since I quickly found my chosen vehicle on the front page; I didn't have to do any extra searching. Furthermore, there are mny potential user flows that the user can find their car that I didn't explore/detail here just because there is so much functionality on the front page.

                                <li>Categories: I will be able to click on these buttons and find works based off categories such as "New Releases". However, if I was looking specifically for a book, this might be confusing if I tried looking for it in a place but I wouldn't know if I'm looking in the right category.</li>

                    Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?
                    <ul><li>
                        I think it was successful since I knew what book I wanted to purchase. Basically, I just used the search bar. However, as a book reader, some of the fun is trying to find new books and I feel like the site doesn't really encourage exploration; the exploration is nested within the navigation.

            <li>Universal: Nav bars, search bars, filters</li>

            <li>Specific: For my complicated processes, such as buying a car for Toyota, there was a combination UI element. </li>
